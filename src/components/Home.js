        <p>Around Our Home…</p>
        <p>*TL;DR only good vibes and real reviews.</p>
        <p>When I look around our house, I want to see a clean space that’s warm and inviting, filled with good memories.  I want the practical stuff to work and to last.  That’s what this site is intended for, real reviews of products we actually use.</p>
        <p>We are influenced daily, hourly.  It can be exhausting.  Why on earth did I buy that, fill in the blank, it’s shoved in some drawer until I eventually have to throw it out.  I’ve wasted so much money on stuff that I was influenced to buy.</p>
        <p>Why do we keep doing this to ourselves?  We are psychologically manipulated; you see something often enough, and you will start to like it.   Influencers are paid to consume.  We pay to consume.  We can never out consume influences, so our homes will never be like the picture they portray.</p>
        <p>I look around my home and feel refreshed, rejuvenated, relaxed.  It’s an evolving picture that takes time and effort to create.</p>
        <p>Come along with us as we continue to boost this home.  We’ll share products that make our lives better.  We deserve wellness and the little pleasures, this is our one life after all.</p>
