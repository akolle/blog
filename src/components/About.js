      <h2 className='mission'>Who We Are</h2>
      <h3 className='emily'>Emily</h3>
        <p> I’m a massage therapist with a passion for health, wellness, and respecting the planet we live on.  I’m the main writer of this blog site, with a love-affair for the Oxford comma. 
I’m an animal mom!  We currently have two cats, one dog, and a one-eyed Oscar fish.  They all have too much personality, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.
        </p>
        <p>I’m a recovering people-pleaser.  I obsessively “research” everything before I buy it.  Not only that, but I will do this to the point of exhaustion, and it typically takes a few days till I actually buy the thing.</p>
        <p>I was probably a shade plant in a previous life.</p>
      <h3 className='andy'>Andy</h3>
        <p>Totally left-brained, amazing tech-guru. His creative flow comes from the keys of a laptop and, surprisingly, the gardens.  He likes things straight and orderly and whatever it is, it better not upset the budget.</p>
        <p>Hates Oxford comma, likes straight lines, loves diggin holes!</p>
